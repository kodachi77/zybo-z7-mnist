# Overview

This repository contains source code for training and synthesizing custom NN for recognizing images using MNIST 
dataset. 

Zybo-Z7-20 is our target hardware platform.

We will synthesize a 3-layer fully connected network with 256 neurons per layer, called SFC, presented in the 
[Xilinx FINN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07119).
